## Bonus Feature: Admin Mode

The project has been adjusted so that some users have 'admin' permissions and can
edit or remove any blog posts and any pages, regardless of the owners of the posts
or pages.

Specifically, a user's email address must be listed in the adminEmails array in
[`assets/scripts/auth/ui.js`](assets/scripts/auth/ui.js) in the frontend client, and the same email address must
appear in the adminEmails array in `lib/custom_errors.js` in the backend
client.

## Structure of this Repository

JavaScript files are all in [`assets/scripts`](assets/scripts). The "manifest"
or entry-point is [`assets/scripts/index.js`](assets/scripts/index.js). That
file invokes [`assets/scripts/events.js`](assets/scripts/events.js), which
contains event listeners for the two buttons visible on the screen when the app
is accessed.

Specifically, the authentication content is handled in [`assets/scripts/auth`](assets/scripts/auth), the site or page content is in [`assets/scripts/page`](assets/scripts/page), and the blog post content is in [`assets/scripts/blog`](assets/scripts/blog).

`apiUrls.production` and `apiUrls.development` are configured in
[`config/environment.js`](config/environment.js).

Styles are stored in [`assets/styles`](assets/styles) and loaded
from [`assets/styles/index.scss`](assets/styles/index.scss). Bootstrap version 3 is
included in this project.

[`getFormFields`](get-form-fields.md) is used to retrieve form data to send to an
API.

To deploy a browser-template based SPA with this project, run `grunt deploy`.

## Development Process Notes

We used pair programming and version control extensively for this project. We
tracked our progress by frequently updating a roadmap document in Google Drive,
which is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdjX9aileNQHbDQVtufrlsvDyM5cQxRPhey_Hl8q9ao/edit?usp=sharing).

## Unsolved Problems and Possible Future Tasks

1. At present, our "pages" aren't really web pages - it's not possible to visit a subdomain for a specific "page."
1. "Pages" and "blogs" aren't connected in any meaningful way - it would be great if they were linked to each other.
1. Authentication is currently done through code hand-rolled by General Assembly instructors. Among other problems, this code never checks if the content in the "password" and "confirm password" boxes on the signup page are the same.
1. It isn't possible yet for users to share ownership of pages or blogs with each other, making our project fairly useless for organizations or teams.
